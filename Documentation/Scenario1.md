# Scenario 1

First you should check out what the application looks like and how it runs before attempting this scenario and any others.  You should also read the documentation about the application too.

In this scenario the users of the system are complaining that there are no updates occurring in the application.  No trades are appearing, or updates to trades.

You will need to work out what the issue is from the application server, as our monitoring system is not detecting any issues with this application.  When you find out what the issue is you should make a note of what the issue was and provide a solution as to how to monitor this problem next time.

You should log on to the server and start your investigation;

ssh -p *SSH* student@*SSHIP*

Where;
- SSH = the port number shown to you for SSH
- SSHIP is the IP address to ssh to
