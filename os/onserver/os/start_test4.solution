# the problem is the trigger has an error.
# to fix the error you can execute the following

SOLUTION 1. CHANGE THE TRIGGER
# 1. Connect to mysql
mysql -h mysql.server -u trades -ptrades trades
# 2. Now you can see trigger code
SHOW CREATE TRIGGER trades.updTrade;

# 3. Now you can delete the trigger code because the tradeHist table is wrong.
# Its real name is TradeHist
DROP TRIGGER trades.updTrade;

# 4. How you can define the correct trigger code
DELIMITER $$
CREATE TRIGGER updTrade AFTER UPDATE ON Trades
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
   INSERT INTO TradesHist (transid,stock,ptime,price,volume,buysell,state,stime,utime)
          VALUES (OLD.transid,OLD.stock,OLD.ptime,OLD.price,OLD.volume,OLD.buysell,OLD.state,OLD.stime,now());
END $$

# 5. DONE

SOLUTION 2. CHANGE THE TABLE NAME
# 1. Connect to mysql
mysql -h mysql.server -u trades -ptrades trades

#2. Create the table with the name the trigger is using
CREATE TABLE TradesHist LIKE tradesTable;

#3. Now you can destroy the original table
DROP TABLE tradesTable;
